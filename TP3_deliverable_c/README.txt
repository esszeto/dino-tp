GAME INTRODUCTION:
The name of my TP is “Dino Dash”, and it is a version of the no internet dino game,
but with various terrains that can be chosen. The rules of the game are pretty similar
to the original version, as there will be different barriers for the dino to jump over
and the game will end when the dino runs into a barrier. The dino’s actions are controlled
by a space bar (to jump) as well as the up/down arrows (to jump or duck down). The
starting screen of the game is a map of the world, where the user can click on a button
to choose a location for the terrain to be set in. Barriers include birds, cacti (on
the desert), and goats (on the mountain).


In order to play the game, the ‘main_dino.py’ file should be run. As the game uses
a unique text style, a font called ‘Press Start 2p’ should be downloaded into the
computer’s font book.
A link to download the font can be found here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P


Shortcuts for the game include:
-- pressing “q” to quit mid-dino run and view the “Game Over” screen.
